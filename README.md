# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Bruno Bianchi**, a passionate programmer pursuing a degree in **Computer Engineering** at [Universidade Federal de ItajubÃ¡ (UNIFEI)](https://www.unifei.edu.br). ðŸš€

## About Me

Iâ€™m a **Full Stack Developer** at [AsimovJr](https://github.com/Asimovjr), with a strong passion for technology, programming, and solving complex challenges. My journey in the tech world began over seven years ago, and I've since gained expertise in:

- **Languages**: TypeScript, JavaScript, Java, Python, R, Haskell
- **Back-End**: Node.js, Nest.js, Prisma, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Firebase
- **Front-End**: Angular
- **Tools**: VS Code, Git

Iâ€™m also actively working on a **Research & Development (R&D) project** for **Vertis**, focused on developing an **automated mobile network monitoring solution**. This project leverages **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** methods to optimize and improve network performance, providing real-time monitoring and analysis.

Iâ€™m always eager to explore new technologies, improve my skills, and contribute to innovative projects.
