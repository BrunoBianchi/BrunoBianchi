## Overview & Strategic Positioning

Software Engineer with over 7 years of experience focused on developing scalable products and providing technical leadership. My expertise lies in architecting distributed systems and Artificial Intelligence solutions applied to real-time data monitoring (such as mobile networks).

I work end-to-end across the product engineering lifecycle: from cloud infrastructure design and data modeling to developing high-concurrency APIs and optimized user interfaces. I resolve performance bottlenecks and ensure application resilience through strict engineering best practices.

**Technical Edge:** Ability to align business objectives with software architecture decisions, ensuring deliveries with clean, testable, and highly scalable code.

## Engineering Mindset & Architecture

My technical leadership and development cycles are built upon the following pillars:

* **Software Architecture:** Modeling based on Clean Architecture, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), and microservices to ensure low coupling and high cohesion.
* **Performance & Scalability:** Development of RESTful APIs and low-latency asynchronous systems, engineered for high request volumes.
* **Code Quality:** Strict adoption of Clean Code, Design Patterns (GoF), and Test-Driven Development (TDD) for predictability and maintainability.
* **DevOps Culture:** Automation of CI/CD pipelines for continuous integration and secure, zero-downtime deployments in containerized environments.
